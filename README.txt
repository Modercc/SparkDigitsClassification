Run logistic.py and random_forest.py to get predictions from my logistic and random forest model, respetively.

You should use the following arguments in this order:
<input_path_to_training_dataset>
<input_path_to_test_dataset>
<path_to_output_directory>

In the output directory you will find test predictions in a .csv file, as well as the training and test accuracy results.
